# Deployment  
  link : https://async-race-front-omega.vercel.app/
  
  The depolyment mostly doesnt work due to non existing backend. The backend is not deployed and the link is not provided in the task. The backend is required to run the application properly. For now it uses localhost:3000 as the backend, which is configured as env variable.
